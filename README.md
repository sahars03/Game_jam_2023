# Is it me you're looking for?

This project was a submission for a game design competition called the 'Game Jam'. The game works like tic-tac-toe: the player to place three of their marks in a row first wins. 
The winner determines the answer to the question 'Is it me you're looking for?'.

#### Installation and how to run

At least python3 is required to run this program. Once the project has been downloaded, navigate to its directory in your terminal and run the following line to open the game:

    python Isitme.py

Once the game opens up, place marks by clicking on the squares. The marks are 'Y' for yes and 'N' for no.
